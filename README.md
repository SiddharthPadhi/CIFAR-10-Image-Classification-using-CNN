# CNN Model on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify images into 10 categories. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib

# Getting Started

    ##Download the Code:

    Save the code in a file named project.py (or any name you prefer) in your working directory.

    ##Run the Code:

    Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where cnn_cifar10.py is saved, and run the following command:

    python project.py
    Note: If python doesnâ€™t work, try python3 instead.

    ##View Training Progress and Results:

    The training progress (loss and accuracy) will be displayed in the terminal, and a plot of the training/validation accuracy and loss will appear at the end.
